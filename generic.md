<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/Danielle.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>I am from Chicago, IL. I completed my Astronomy (Honors) and Physics Majors from The University of Arizona in Spring 2021. I began work as a PhD student at Purdue University the following semester. I work with Danny Milisavljevic on enhance mass loss in massive stars before stellar death. </p>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/IMG_7984.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>I love cooking and being outdoors. Namely, I enjoy rock climbing and stargazing, which often overlap due to the remoteness of the best climbing areas.</p>
