<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/af23c50f-8dc9-4fbd-b247-927c21fcf048.JPG %}" alt="" /></span>I am a science communicator with <a href='https://www.physics.purdue.edu/outreach/saturday-morning/' >Saturday Morning Astrophysics</a>(SMAP) at Purdue. I am a teaching assistant in monthly in SMAP lessons where we present topics to middle and high school students and delve deep into them via discussions and demos. In Spring 2023, I had the amazing opportunity to travel to Medell√≠n, Colombia and teach high school students at AstroCamp 2023. Dave Sederberg (faculty), Alan Wright (Master's student), Mariana Aguilar (undergraduate), and I lectured and led many experiments with the students. To teach the physics behind supernovae, I had students perform the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UHS883_P60'>Galilean Canon</a> drop, and to demonstrate how supernovae are affected by their environments, students made spice remnants (which is similar to <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho0o7H6dXSU'>this phenomenon</a>).</p>

<p>As a student at the University of Arizona, I worked at the Flandrau Science Center and Planetarium. I was a science center interpreter and a plantarium operator, educating the public via Flandrau's many interdisciplinary exhibits and via star talks and many planetarium shows. </p>
