<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/Danielle.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>I am from the Northwest Suburbs of Chicago, IL. I completed my Astronomy (Honors) and Physics Majors, with minors in Mathematics and Spanish, from The University of Arizona in Spring 2021. I began work as a PhD student at Purdue University the following semester. I work with Danny Milisavljevic on enhanced mass loss in massive stars before stellar death. </p>

<p>Fun Fact: When Bhagya Subrayan and our group first took interest in AT 2021lwx, I mistakenly read its ZTF ID (ZTF20abrbeie) as Barbie! Ever since then, we have referred to this transient as "Scary Barbie." Check out <a href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...948L..19S/abstract">Bhagya's paper on Barbie!</a> The study and naming of this object came at the perfect time with Greta Gerwig's movie coming out. And yes, I did do Barbenheimer, and I saw Barbie first.</p>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/IMG_7984.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>I love cooking and being outdoors. Namely, I enjoy rock climbing and stargazing, which often overlap due to the remoteness of the best climbing areas. I frequently travel to the Red River Gorge to climb and "hang" out! The picture to the right is one such adventure to "the Red."
